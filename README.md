# SQL Practice 📊📁

This repository contains a series of SQL query exercises performed on multiple datasets to practice and demonstrate SQL skills. The datasets and exercise prompts are sourced from the [kiwidamien SQL practice repository](https://github.com/kiwidamien/SQL_practice). Each dataset focuses on different real-world scenarios and allows exploration of common SQL operations including filtering, aggregation, joins, and subqueries.

## 📁 Datasets

### 1. Seattle Weather
- Data on daily weather in Seattle.
- Focus on temperature trends, rainfall statistics, and date-based filtering.

### 2. Employee
- Simulated employee data including management relationships.
- Exercises cover joins, hierarchy, and salary-based queries.

### 3. Social Network
- Simulated user base and their follow relationships.
- Analyze social structures, reciprocal connections, and house affiliations.

### 4. Orders
- Product and transaction data.
- Includes customer behaviors, pricing analysis, and order aggregation.

### 5. Election
- Voting data for analyzing results and trends.
- Focus on voter turnout, party performance, and vote distribution.

## 📌 Objectives

- Execute SQL queries for filtering, sorting, and grouping.
- Perform aggregations like averages, percentiles, and counts.
- Utilize joins for relational insights.
- Create derived statistics and relationship mappings.

## 🔧 Tools and SQL Queries Used

- SQL dialect used: SQLite.
- Environment: SQLite running within Jupyter Notebooks via `%sql` magic command.
- Core SQL features utilized:
  - `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
  - Aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `COUNT()`, `STDDEV()`
  - Conditional logic: `CASE WHEN`, `IS NULL`, `LIKE`
  - Joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
  - Subqueries and views for complex logic abstraction
  - Date filtering and formatting

## 💡 Conclusion

This SQL practice project offered hands-on experience across diverse datasets simulating real-world database structures. It strengthened understanding of SQL querying, data relationships, and analytical techniques essential for data exploration and business intelligence.
